# Modern Responsive Websites
Date: June 18,2024

Starting the Modern Responsive Websites course conducted by Brad Traversy. I want to brush up on my html, css, and version control. There will be 3 project websites that I will build as I go through this course.

I will strengthen my knowledge in web development and will be my starting point on my journey to more web projects going forward.
